					<p>When talking about success, people will think about the successful career and a lot of fortune. It seems that owing the fame and the money can make a person perfect. We are easy to envy others for the things they have, as the saying that the food is delicious next door. But we must realize that sometimes we are envied by others.When they communicate with each other, they find that they envy about each other.

					<p>I like teamwork because I can learn from others. Once, I was very shy and did not know how to get along with other students, so everytime when the teacher gave us the task and asked us to finish in the teamwork, I was very scared. Then my classmates helped me, they gave me a lot opinion and they respected me, making me the indispensable person. </p>

				<p>When I was in primary school, my parents had paid special attention to the English education, they thought it was the necessary language to learn. So I had access to the English movie and the relatived books. I fell in love with learning English, because speaking English made me stand out. Later I found an English club in my school, it was a place for the English learner to improve their speaking skill and gain their interest. </p>
